# NeuroGrid API Demo Features

This document outlines the features of the NeuroGrid API demo and how they showcase the capabilities of the NeuroGrid API.

## 1. API Code Example

The "API Code Example" section displays a sample code snippet for fetching real-time neural data from the NeuroGrid API. This demonstrates the following:

-   **Ease of Use:** The API is designed to be simple and intuitive, following standard REST conventions.
-   **Clear Endpoints:** The API provides clear and predictable endpoints for accessing data.
-   **Standard Data Format:** The API returns data in JSON format, which is easy to parse and use in any programming language.

## 2. Simulated API Response

The "Simulated API Response" section displays a real-time stream of simulated neural data. This demonstrates the following:

-   **Real-Time Data:** The NeuroGrid API can provide a continuous stream of real-time neural data.
-   **Rich Data:** The API provides a rich set of data for each neural signal, including a timestamp, signal type, strength, and whether noise cancellation has been applied.
-   **Reliability:** The simulated response is designed to be stable and reliable, reflecting the quality of the NeuroGrid API.

## 3. Overall Design

The overall design of the demo is clean, modern, and professional, reflecting the NeuroGrid brand. The demo is designed to be easy to understand and use, even for non-technical users.
