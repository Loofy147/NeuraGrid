## Slide 2: The Problem

**The BCI Revolution is Stuck in the Lab.**

*   **Headline:** Brain-Computer Interfaces fail at scale for one reason: **Bad data.**
*   **Invasive Solutions (e.g., Neuralink):**
    *   Require risky surgery.
    *   Cost prohibitive ($100K+).
    *   Market is limited to critical medical cases.
*   **Non-Invasive Solutions (e.g., EEG Headsets):**
    *   Unreliable outside of controlled lab environments.
    *   Require messy gels, shaving, and constant recalibration.
    *   30-minute setup creates massive user friction.
*   **The Market Gap:** There is no BCI that works reliably for everyday use in the real world.

## Slide 3: The Solution

**Infrastructure, Not Just another Interface.**

*   **Headline:** We don't build apps. We build the picks and shovels for the neural revolution.
*   **Introducing NeuroGrid:** The world's first distributed neural signal infrastructure.
*   **What We Do:** We provide clean, reliable neural data through a simple API, enabling developers to build BCI applications for the real world.
*   **Three Core Innovations:**
    1.  **Adaptive Contact Sensors:** Works anywhere, no gel, no calibration. (Hardware)
    2.  **Environmental Noise Cancellation:** Clean signal in chaotic environments. (Algorithm/Data)
    3.  **Developer-First API:** Simple, powerful, and scalable. (Platform)

## Slide 7: Go-To-Market - A Phased Approach

**De-Risking the Business with a Beachhead Market.**

*   **Phase 1: Medical & Research (Years 1-2)**
    *   **Target:** Neurology labs, sleep clinics.
    *   **Why:** High willingness to pay ($2-5K/device), validates technology in a demanding environment.
    *   **Goal:** Establish the technology, secure FDA Class II clearance (18-month process underway).
*   **Phase 2: Developer Platform (Years 2-3)**
    *   **Target:** BCI app developers, neurofeedback startups.
    *   **Why:** Build a moat by getting developers to build on our platform (lock-in).
    *   **Goal:** Seed the ecosystem, grow API revenue.
*   **Phase 3: Consumer (Years 3-5)**
    *   **Target:** Focus, sleep, and meditation apps.
    *   **Why:** Address the mass market once the technology is proven, FDA cleared, and an app ecosystem exists.

## Slide 8: The Competition - Why We Win

**A Moat Built on a 3-Year Head Start.**

*   **vs. Invasive BCIs (e.g., Neuralink):**
    *   **We Are:** Non-invasive, 1000x larger market, fraction of the cost.
    *   **They Are:** A different, surgical market. We don't compete directly.
*   **vs. Consumer EEG (e.g., Muse):**
    *   **We Have:** Superior, patented sensor technology that works anywhere.
    *   **They Have:** Commodity sensors that require a controlled environment.
*   **vs. Big Tech (e.g., Apple/Meta):**
    *   **Our Moat:**
        1.  **Data:** 3+ year head start on our proprietary neural signal dataset.
        2.  **Patents:** Sensor patents block their approach.
        3.  **Regulatory:** We're already 12+ months into the FDA process. They'd be years behind.
    *   **Outcome:** They are a more likely acquirer than a competitor.
